Automatically test web-services with [[https://www.openapis.org/][OpenAPI]] specifications, utilizing [[https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/][pytest]] and [[https://hypothesis.works/][hypothesis]].

When run, a series of tests will be automatically generated and run based on the OpenAPI specification of the given web-service. If a test fails, ~hypothesis~ will find and return a minimal example that causes the found issue.

Currently, the following is implemented:
- Check, whether the specification is a valid OpenAPI specification, using [[https://github.com/python-openapi/openapi-spec-validator][openapi-spec-validator]]
- Parse the specification and automatically generate tests according to the input types of each end-point. This test is considered to fail when the response code is different from 200. For this, the following types are supported:
  - ~enum~
  - ~string~ (i.e. text),
    with minimum / maximum length
  - ~number~,
    with minimum / maximum value (optionally exclusive)
  - ~boolean~

* Usage

** With Nix

To run the tests on any running web-service, use
#+begin_src sh
nix run github:openeduhub/auto-openapi-tests -- --api "http://<web-service>" --spec-loc "<openapi-json-endpoint>"
#+end_src

See ~nix run github:openeduhub/auto-openapi-tests -- --help~ for more information on possible command line arguments.

** Installed through pip
